# 🏊‍♂️ 42 Discovery Piscine – Python

This repository contains my work during the **42 Discovery Piscine**, where I explored the fundamentals of programming using **Python**, following the peer-learning philosophy of **École 42**.

## 📌 About the Discovery Piscine

The Discovery Piscine is an intensive introduction to programming and problem-solving.  
It focuses on:

- Logical thinking (not mathematics)
- Learning by doing
- Peer-learning and peer-evaluation
- Understanding that there is no single correct solution
- Writing clean and functional code

Each participant progresses at their own pace, and the goal is to **understand core concepts**, not to rush perfection.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout this Piscine, I practiced:

- Python basics and syntax
- Using `while` loops and nested loops
- Handling user input
- Conditional logic
- Output formatting
- Writing executable scripts
- Following strict subject requirements
- Debugging logical mistakes
- Organizing projects properly

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository follows a **cell-based structure**, where each cell represents a set of exercises.

Each cell contains:
- A Markdown explanation file (`.md`)
- The subject PDF (`en.subject.pdf`)
- One or more Python scripts (`.py`)
